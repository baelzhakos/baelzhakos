# 🐭✨ Welcome to Baelz’s Chaos Corner! ✨🐭  
- Hiya! I’m **Baelz**, but you can just call me **Bae** if you want~  
- I’m **18**, and honestly? Just a little ball of chaos wrapped in quiet moments!!
- I might look quiet but inside there’s a thousand ideas, random thoughts, and probably a caffeine-fueled hamster wheel spinning nonstop! I'm just that exotic~
- You can find more about myself in my **pronouns.cc**!!

## I'm taken and I do not tolerate disrespect towards me or my partner.
